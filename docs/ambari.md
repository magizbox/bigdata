# Ambari

The Apache Ambari project is aimed at making Hadoop management simpler by developing software for provisioning, managing, and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters. Ambari provides an intuitive, easy-to-use Hadoop management web UI backed by its RESTful APIs.

Ambari enables System Administrators to:

* Provision a Hadoop Cluster
    * Ambari provides a step-by-step wizard for installing Hadoop services across any number of hosts.
    * Ambari handles configuration of Hadoop services for the cluster.

* Manage a Hadoop Cluster
    * Ambari provides central management for starting, stopping, and reconfiguring Hadoop services across the entire cluster.

* Monitor a Hadoop Cluster
    * Ambari provides a dashboard for monitoring health and status of the Hadoop cluster.
    * Ambari leverages Ambari Metrics System for metrics collection.
    * Ambari leverages Ambari Alert Framework for system alerting and will notify you when your attention is needed (e.g., a node goes down, remaining disk space is low, etc).

Ambari enables Application Developers and System Integrators to:

* Easily integrate Hadoop provisioning, management, and monitoring capabilities to their own applications with the Ambari REST APIs.
